# Capcom Interview -Financial Summary

## Overview
 For this mini coding challenge, I implemented logic for the 'FinancialSummary'. Also, I added tests for Financial Summary to cover additional corner cases not available in the original script.
 
## Requirements
- Financial Summary
    - A summary of count and amount of deposits, withdraws, refunds, antes, purchases for a given user and currency
    - A summary spans over one day, seven days and a lifetime of a user's transactions

## The Problem
- Implement the logic for the `FinancialSummary`.
- There are pending specs that you should make pass.
- The specs are non-exhaustive (hint hint).

## Additional Test Cases
FinancialSummary:
 - check if FinancialSummary will correctly show summary from correct user.
 - check if correctly display correct summary span over one day.
